## Documentation

<!-- If this is an issue with the current documentation for NumPy (i.e.
incomplete/innacurate docstring, unclear explanation in any part of the
documentation), make sure to leave a reference to the document/code you're
referring to. You can also check the development version of the documentation
and see if this issue has already been addressed: https://numpy.org/devdocs/
-->

<!-- If this is an idea or a request for content, please describe as clearly as
possible what topics you think are missing from the current documentation. Make
sure to check https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials and see if this issue
might be more appropriate there. -->
