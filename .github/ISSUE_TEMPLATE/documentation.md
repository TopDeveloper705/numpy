incomplete/innacurate docstring, unclear explanation in any part of the
documentation), make sure to leave a reference to the document/code you're
referring to. -->

<!-- If this is an idea or a request for content, please describe as clearly as
possible what topics you think are missing from the current documentation. Make
sure to check https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials and see if this issue
might be more appropriate there. -->

<!-- If this is about the content in https://numpy.org, please open an issue at
the https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org repo instead. -->
