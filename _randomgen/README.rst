RandomGen
=========

|Travis Build Status| |Appveyor Build Status| |PyPI version|

Random Number Generator using settable Basic RNG interface for future
NumPy RandomState evolution.

This is a library and generic interface for alternative random
generators in Python and NumPy.

Compatibility Warning
---------------------

``RandomGenerator`` does not support Box-Muller normal variates and so
it not 100% compatible with NumPy (or randomstate). Box-Muller normals
are slow to generate and all functions which previously relied on
Box-Muller normals now use the faster Ziggurat implementation. If you
require backward compatibility, a legacy generator, ``LegacyGenerator``,
has been created which can fully reproduce the sequence produced by
NumPy.

Features
--------

-  Replacement for NumPy’s RandomState

   .. code:: python

      from randomgen import RandomGenerator, MT19937
      rnd = RandomGenerator(MT19937())
      x = rnd.standard_normal(100)
      y = rnd.random_sample(100)
      z = rnd.randn(10,10)

-  Default random generator is a fast generator called Xoroshiro128plus
-  Support for random number generators that support independent streams
   and jumping ahead so that sub-streams can be generated
-  Faster random number generation, especially for normal, standard
   exponential and standard gamma using the Ziggurat method

   .. code:: python

      from randomgen import RandomGenerator
      # Default basic PRNG is Xoroshiro128
      rnd = RandomGenerator()
      w = rnd.standard_normal(10000, method='zig')
      x = rnd.standard_exponential(10000, method='zig')
      y = rnd.standard_gamma(5.5, 10000, method='zig')

-  Support for 32-bit floating randoms for core generators. Currently
   supported:

   -  Uniforms (``random_sample``)
   -  Exponentials (``standard_exponential``, both Inverse CDF and
      Ziggurat)
   -  Normals (``standard_normal``)
   -  Standard Gammas (via ``standard_gamma``)

   **WARNING**: The 32-bit generators are **experimental** and subject
   to change.

   **Note**: There are *no* plans to extend the alternative precision
   generation to all distributions.

-  Support for filling existing arrays using ``out`` keyword argument.
   Currently supported in (both 32- and 64-bit outputs)

   -  Uniforms (``random_sample``)
   -  Exponentials (``standard_exponential``)
   -  Normals (``standard_normal``)
   -  Standard Gammas (via ``standard_gamma``)

-  Support for Lemire’s method of generating uniform integers on an
   arbitrary interval by setting ``use_masked=True``.

Included Pseudo Random Number Generators
----------------------------------------

This module includes a number of alternative random number generators in
addition to the MT19937 that is included in NumPy. The RNGs include:

-  `MT19937 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/random/mtrand/>`__,
   the NumPy rng
-  `dSFMT <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/>`__ a
   SSE2-aware version of the MT19937 generator that is especially fast
   at generating doubles
-  `xoroshiro128+ <http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/>`__,
   `xorshift1024*φ <http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/>`__,
   `xoshiro256*\* <http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/>`__, and
   `xoshiro512*\* <http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/>`__
-  `PCG64 <http://www.pcg-random.org/>`__
-  ThreeFry and Philox from
   `Random123 <https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html>`__

Differences from ``numpy.random.RandomState``
---------------------------------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``standard_normal``, ``normal``, ``randn`` and
   ``multivariate_normal`` all use the much faster (100%+) Ziggurat
   method.
-  ``standard_gamma`` and ``gamma`` both use the much faster Ziggurat
   method.
-  ``standard_exponential`` ``exponential`` both support an additional
   ``method`` keyword argument which can be ``inv`` or ``zig`` where
   ``inv`` corresponds to the current method using the inverse CDF and
   ``zig`` uses the much faster (100%+) Ziggurat method.
-  Core random number generators can produce either single precision
   (``np.float32``) or double precision (``np.float64``, the default)
   using the optional keyword argument ``dtype``
-  Core random number generators can fill existing arrays using the
   ``out`` keyword argument
-  Standardizes integer-values random values as int64 for all platforms.
-  ``randint`` supports generating using rejection sampling on masked
   values (the default) or Lemire’s method. Lemire’s method can be much
   faster when the required interval length is much smaller than the
   closes power of 2.

New Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``random_entropy`` - Read from the system entropy provider, which is
   commonly used in cryptographic applications
-  ``random_raw`` - Direct access to the values produced by the
   underlying PRNG. The range of the values returned depends on the
   specifics of the PRNG implementation.
-  ``random_uintegers`` - unsigned integers, either 32-
   (``[0, 2**32-1]``) or 64-bit (``[0, 2**64-1]``)
-  ``jump`` - Jumps RNGs that support it. ``jump`` moves the state a
   great distance. *Only available if supported by the RNG.*
-  ``advance`` - Advanced the RNG ‘as-if’ a number of draws were made,
   without actually drawing the numbers. *Only available if supported by
   the RNG.*

Status
------

-  Builds and passes all tests on:

   -  Linux 32/64 bit, Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
   -  PC-BSD (FreeBSD) 64-bit, Python 2.7
   -  OSX 64-bit, Python 3.6
   -  Windows 32/64 bit, Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6

Version
-------

The version matched the latest version of NumPy where
``RandomGenerator(MT19937())`` passes all NumPy test.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the latest release is available on `my GitHub
pages <http://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/>`__. Documentation for the
latest commit (unreleased) is available under
`devel <http://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/devel/>`__.

Plans
-----

This module is essentially complete. There are a few rough edges that
need to be smoothed.

-  Creation of additional streams from where supported (i.e. a
   ``next_stream()`` method)

Requirements
------------

Building requires:

-  Python (2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7)
-  NumPy (1.13, 1.14, 1.15)
-  Cython (0.26+)
-  tempita (0.5+), if not provided by Cython

Testing requires pytest (3.0+).

**Note:** it might work with other versions but only tested with these
versions.

Development and Testing
-----------------------

All development has been on 64-bit Linux, and it is regularly tested on
Travis-CI (Linux/OSX) and Appveyor (Windows). The library is
occasionally tested on Linux 32-bit and Free BSD 11.1.

Basic tests are in place for all RNGs. The MT19937 is tested against
NumPy’s implementation for identical results. It also passes NumPy’s
test suite where still relevant.

Installing
----------

Either install from PyPi using

.. code:: bash

   pip install randomgen

or, if you want the latest version,

.. code:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/bashtage/randomgen.git

or from a cloned repo,

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install

SSE2
~~~~

``dSFTM`` makes use of SSE2 by default. If you have a very old computer
or are building on non-x86, you can install using:

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install --no-sse2

Windows
~~~~~~~

Either use a binary installer, or if building from scratch, use Python
3.6 with Visual Studio 2015/2017 Community Edition. It can also be build
using Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 and Python 2.7.

Using
-----

The separate generators are importable from ``randomgen``

.. code:: python

   from randomgen import RandomGenerator, ThreeFry, PCG64, MT19937
   rg = RandomGenerator(ThreeFry())
   rg.random_sample(100)

   rg = RandomGenerator(PCG64())
   rg.random_sample(100)

   # Identical to NumPy
   rg = RandomGenerator(MT19937())
   rg.random_sample(100)

License
-------

Standard NCSA, plus sub licenses for components.

Performance
-----------

Performance is promising, and even the mt19937 seems to be faster than
NumPy’s mt19937.
