cdef class Philox:
    """
    Philox(seed=None, counter=None, key=None)

    Container for the Philox (4x64) pseudo-random number generator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        Random seed initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
        Can be an integer in [0, 2**64-1], array of integers in
        [0, 2**64-1] or ``None`` (the default). If `seed` is ``None``,
        data will be read from ``/dev/urandom`` (or the Windows analog)
        if available.  If unavailable, a hash of the time and process ID is
        used.
    counter : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        Counter to use in the Philox state. Can be either
        a Python int (long in 2.x) in [0, 2**256) or a 4-element uint64 array.
        If not provided, the RNG is initialized at 0.
    key : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        Key to use in the Philox state.  Unlike seed, which is run through
        another RNG before use, the value in key is directly set. Can be either
        a Python int (long in 2.x) in [0, 2**128) or a 2-element uint64 array.
        key and seed cannot both be used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lock: threading.Lock
        Lock instance that is shared so that the same bit git generator can
        be used in multiple Generators without corrupting the state. Code that
        generates values from a bit generator should hold the bit generator's
        lock.

    Notes
    -----
    Philox is a 64-bit PRNG that uses a counter-based design based on weaker
    (and faster) versions of cryptographic functions [1]_. Instances using
    different values of the key produce independent sequences.  Philox has a
    period of :math:`2^{256} - 1` and supports arbitrary advancing and jumping
    the sequence in increments of :math:`2^{128}`. These features allow
    multiple non-overlapping sequences to be generated.

    ``Philox`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
    doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
    directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
    or similar object that supports low-level access.

    See ``ThreeFry`` for a closely related PRNG.

    **State and Seeding**

    The ``Philox`` state vector consists of a 2 256-bit values encoded as
    4-element uint64 arrays. One is a counter which is incremented by 1 for
    every 4 64-bit randoms produced.  The second is a key which determined
    the sequence produced.  Using different keys produces independent
    sequences.

    ``Philox`` is seeded using either a single 64-bit unsigned integer
    or a vector of 64-bit unsigned integers.  In either case, the seed is
    used as an input for a second random number generator,
    SplitMix64, and the output of this PRNG function is used as the initial state.
    Using a single 64-bit value for the seed can only initialize a small range of
    the possible initial state values.

    **Parallel Features**

    ``Philox`` can be used in parallel applications by calling the ``jumped``
    method  to advances the state as-if :math:`2^{128}` random numbers have
    been generated. Alternatively, ``advance`` can be used to advance the
    counter for any positive step in [0, 2**256). When using ``jumped``, all
    generators should be chained to ensure that the segments come from the same
    sequence.

    >>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox
    >>> bit_generator = Philox(1234)
    >>> rg = []
    >>> for _ in range(10):
    ...    rg.append(Generator(bit_generator))
    ...    bit_generator = bit_generator.jumped()

    Alternatively, ``Philox`` can be used in parallel applications by using
    a sequence of distinct keys where each instance uses different key.

    >>> key = 2**96 + 2**33 + 2**17 + 2**9
    >>> rg = [Generator(Philox(key=key+i)) for i in range(10)]

    **Compatibility Guarantee**

    ``Philox`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed and will always produce
    the same random integer stream.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox
    >>> rg = Generator(Philox(1234))
    >>> rg.standard_normal()
    0.123  # random

        Advancing a RNG updates the underlying RNG state as-if a given

        there is not a one-to-one relationship between the number output
        random values from a particular distribution and the number of
        draws from the core RNG.  This occurs for two reasons:

        * The random values are simulated using a rejection-based method
          and so, on average, more than one value from the underlying
          RNG is required to generate an single draw.
        * The number of bits required to generate a simulated value
          differs from the number of bits generated by the underlying
          RNG.  For example, two 16-bit integer values can be simulated
          from a single draw of a 32-bit RNG.

        Advancing the RNG state resets any pre-computed random numbers.
        This is required to ensure exact reproducibility.
