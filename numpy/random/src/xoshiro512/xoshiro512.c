/* This is xoshiro512** 1.0, an all-purpose, rock-solid generator. It has
   excellent (about 1ns) speed, an increased state (512 bits) that is
   large enough for any parallel application, and it passes all tests we
   are aware of.

   For generating just floating-point numbers, xoshiro512+ is even faster.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
