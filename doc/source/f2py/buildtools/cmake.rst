Using via ``cmake``
===================

In terms of complexity, ``cmake`` falls between ``make`` and ``meson``. The
learning curve is steeper since CMake syntax is not pythonic and is closer to
``make`` with environment variables.

However, the tradeoff is enhanced flexibility and support for most architectures
and compilers. An introduction to the syntax is out of scope for this document,
but the `official CMake Tutorials`_ are a fantastic resource.
