Bit Generators
--------------

.. currentmodule:: numpy.random

The random values produced by :class:`~Generator` 
orignate in a BitGenerator.  The BitGenerators do not directly provide
random numbers and only contains methods used for seeding, getting or
setting the state, jumping or advancing the state, and for accessing 
low-level wrappers for consumption by code that can efficiently 
access the functions provided, e.g., `numba <https://numba.pydata.org>`_.
