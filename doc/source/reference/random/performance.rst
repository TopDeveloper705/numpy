Recommendation
**************
The recommended generator for single use is :class:`~PCG64`.

Timings
*******

The timings below are the time in ns to produce 1 random value from a
specific distribution.  The original :class:`~mt19937.MT19937` generator is
much slower since it requires 2 32-bit values to equal the output of the
faster generators.

Integer performance has a similar ordering.

The pattern is similar for other, more complex generators. The normal
performance of the legacy :class:`~mtrand.RandomState` generator is much
lower than the other since it uses the Box-Muller transformation rather
than the Ziggurat generator. The performance gap for Exponentials is also
large due to the cost of computing the log function to invert the CDF.
The column labeled MT19973 is used the same 32-bit generator as
:class:`~mtrand.RandomState` but produces random values using
:class:`~generator.Generator`.

Performance on different Operating Systems
******************************************
Performance differs across platforms due to compiler and hardware availability
(e.g., register width) differences. The default bit generator has been chosen
to perform well on 64-bit platforms.  Performance on 32-bit operating systems
is very different.

The values reported are normalized relative to the speed of MT19937 in
each table. A value of 100 indicates that the performance matches the MT19937.
Higher values indicate improved performance. These values cannot be compared
across tables.

32-bit Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The performance of 64-bit generators on 32-bit Windows is much lower than on 64-bit
operating systems due to register width. MT19937, the generator that has been
in NumPy since 2005, operates on 32-bit integers.

   Linux timings used Ubuntu 18.04 and GCC 7.4.  Windows timings were made on Windows 10
   using Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19 (Visual Studio 2015). All timings
