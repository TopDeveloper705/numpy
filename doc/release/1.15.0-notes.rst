==========================
NumPy 1.15.0 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights
==========


New functions
=============

* `np.gcd` and `np.lcm`, to compute the greatest common divisor and least
  common multiple.
* `np.ma.stack`, the `np.stack` array-joining function generalized to masked
  arrays.


Deprecations
============

* Aliases of builtin `pickle` functions are deprecated, in favor of their
  unaliased ``pickle.<func>`` names:

  * `np.loads`
  * `np.core.numeric.load`
  * `np.core.numeric.loads`
  * `np.ma.loads`, `np.ma.dumps`
  * `np.ma.load`, `np.ma.dump` - these functions already failed on python 3,
    when called with a string.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================


C API changes
=============


New Features
============

``np.gcd`` and ``np.lcm`` ufuncs added for integer and objects types
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These compute the greatest common divisor, and lowest common multiple,
respectively. These work on all the numpy integer types, as well as the
builtin arbitrary-precision `Decimal` and `long` types.
