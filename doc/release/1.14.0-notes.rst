Improvements

GIL released for all ``np.einsum`` variations
---------------------------------------------

Some specific loop structures which have an accelerated loop version
did not release the GIL prior to NumPy 1.14.0.  This oversight has been
fixed.


Changes
=======

0d arrays now print their elements like other arrays
----------------------------------------------------
0d arrays now use the array2string formatters to print their elements, like
other arrays. The `style` argument of array2string is now non-functional.

integer scalars are now unaffected by ``np.set_string_function``
----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously the str/repr of integer scalars could be controlled by
``np.set_string_function``, unlike most other numpy scalars. This is no longer
the case.
