New Features
============

`numpy.testing.Tester` is now aware of ``nose`` plugins that are outside the
built-in ones in ``nose``.  This allows using for example ``nose-timer`` like
so:  ``np.test(extra_argv=['--with-timer', '--timer-top-n', '20'])`` to
obtain the runtime of the 20 slowest tests.  An extra keyword ``timer`` was
also added to ``Tester.test``, so ``np.test(timer=20)`` will also report the 20
slowest tests.


Improvements
============

GIL released for all ``np.einsum`` variations
---------------------------------------------

Some specific loop structures which have an accelerated loop version
did not release the GIL prior to NumPy 1.14.0.  This oversight has been
fixed.


Changes
=======

0d arrays now print their elements like other arrays
----------------------------------------------------
0d arrays now use the array2string formatters to print their elements, like
other arrays. The `style` argument of array2string is now non-functional.

integer scalars are now unaffected by ``np.set_string_function``
----------------------------------------------------------------
Previously the str/repr of integer scalars could be controlled by
``np.set_string_function``, unlike most other numpy scalars. This is no longer
the case.
