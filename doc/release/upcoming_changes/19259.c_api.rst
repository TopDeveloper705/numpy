Masked inner-loops cannot be customized anymore
-----------------------------------------------
The masked inner-loop selector is now never used.  A warning
will be given in the unlikely event that it was customized.

We do not expect that any code uses this.  If you do use it,
you must unset unset the selector on newer NumPy version.
Please also contact the NumPy developers, we do anticipate
providing a new, more specific, mechanism.

This change will not affect the results of operations, since
the fallback (which is always used internally) will handle
the operation equivalently, the customization was a planned
feature to allow for faster masked operation.
