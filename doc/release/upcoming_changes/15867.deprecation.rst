``numpy.ndarray.tostring()`` is deprecated in favor of ``tobytes()``
--------------------------------------------------------------------
`~numpy.ndarray.tobytes` has existed since the 1.9 release, but until this release `~numpy.ndarray.tostring` emitted no warning.
The change to emit a warning brings NumPy in line with the builtin `array.array` methods of the same name.
