Improved performance in integer division of NumPy arrays
--------------------------------------------------------
Integer division of NumPy arrays now uses `libdivide <https://libdivide.com/>` 
when the divisor is a constant. With the usage of libdivde and
other minor optimizations, there is a large speedup.
The ``//`` operator and ``np.floor_divide`` makes use
of the new changes.
