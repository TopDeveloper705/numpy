A ``.clang-format`` file has been added
---------------------------------------
Clang-format is a C/C++ code formatter, together with the added
``.clang-format`` file, it produces code close enough to the NumPy
C_STYLE_GUIDE for general use. Clang-format version 12+ is required
due to the use of several new features, it is available in
Fedora 34 and Ubuntu Focal among other distributions.
