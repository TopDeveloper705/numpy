C-Level string to datetime casts changed
----------------------------------------
The C-level casts from strings were simplified. This changed
also fixes string to datetime and timedelta casts to behave
correctly (i.e. like Python casts using ``string_arr.astype("M8")``
while previously the cast would behave like
``string_arr.astype(np.int_).astype("M8")``.
This only affects code using low-level C-API to do manual casts
(not full array casts) of single scalar values or using e.g.
``PyArray_GetCastFunc``, and should thus not affect the vast majority
of users.
