Same kind casting in concatenate with ``axis=None``
---------------------------------------------------
Unlike most `~numpy.concatenate` calls, when no axis
was given (the ravelled arrays being concatenated)
previously "unsafe" casting was used.
This is now deprecated and "same kind" casting will be
used by default. The new ``casting`` keyword argument
can be used to retain the old behaviour.
