Removed floor division support for complex types
------------------------------------------------

Floor division of complex types will now result in a `TypeError`

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a = np.arange(10) + 1j* np.arange(10)
    >>> a // 1
    TypeError: ufunc 'floor_divide' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''
