Annotating the main Numpy namespace
--------------------------------------
Starting from the 1.20 release, PEP 484 type annotations have been included
for parts of the NumPy library; annotating the remaining functions being a
work in progress. With the release of 1.22 this process has been completed for
the main NumPy namespace, which is now fully annotated.

Besides the main namespace, a limited number of sub-packages contain
annotations as well. This includes, among others, `numpy.testing`,
`numpy.linalg` and `numpy.random` (available since 1.21).
