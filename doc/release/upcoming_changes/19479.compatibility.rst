Distutils forces strict floating point model on clang
-----------------------------------------------------
NumPy now sets the ``-ftrapping-math`` option on clang to enforce correct
floating point error handling for universal functions.
Clang defaults to non-IEEE and C99 conform behaviour otherwise.
This change (using the equivalent but newer ``-ffp-exception-behavior=strict``)
was attempted in NumPy 1.21, but was effectively never used.
