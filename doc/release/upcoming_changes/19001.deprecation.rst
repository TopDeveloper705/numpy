Exceptions will be raised during array-like creation
----------------------------------------------------
When an object raised an exception during access of the special
attributes ``__array__`` or ``__array_interface__``, this exception
was usually ignored.
A warning is now given when the exception is anything but AttributeError.
To silence the warning, the type raising the exception has to be adapted
to raise an ``AttributeError``.
