Use of ``ufunc->type_resolver`` and "type tuple"
------------------------------------------------
NumPy now normalizes the "type tuple" argument to the
type resolver functions before calling it.  Note that in
the use of this type resolver is legacy behaviour and NumPy
will not do so when possible.
Calling ``ufunc->type_resolver`` or ``PyUFunc_DefaultTypeResolver``
is strongly discouraged and will now enforce a normalized
type tuple if done.
Note that this does not affect providing a type resolver, which
is expected to keep working in most circumstances.
If you have an unexpected use-case for calling the type resolver,
please inform the NumPy developers so that a solution can be found.
