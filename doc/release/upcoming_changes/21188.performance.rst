Faster operations on NumPy scalars
----------------------------------
Many operations on NumPy scalars are now significantly faster, although
rare operations (e.g. with 0-D arrays rather than scalars) may be slower
in some cases.
However, even with these improvements users who want the best performance
for their scalars, may want to convert a known NumPy scalar into a Python
one using `scalar.item()`.
