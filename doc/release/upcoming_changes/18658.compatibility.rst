``/usr/include`` removed from default include paths
---------------------------------------------------
The default include paths when building a package with ``numpy.distutils`` no
longer include ``/usr/include``. This path is normally added by the compiler,
and hardcoding it can be problematic. In case this causes a problem, please
open an issue. A workaround is documented in PR 18658.
