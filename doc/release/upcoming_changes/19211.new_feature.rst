``keepdims`` optional argument added to `numpy.argmin`, `numpy.argmax`
----------------------------------------------------------------------

``keepdims`` argument is added to `numpy.argmin`, `numpy.argmax`.
If set to ``True``, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one.
The resulting array has the same number of dimensions and will broadcast with the
input array.
