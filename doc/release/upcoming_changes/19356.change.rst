`numpy.vectorize` functions now produce the same output class as the base function
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a function that respects `numpy.ndarray` subclasses is vectorized using
`numpy.vectorize`, the vectorized function will now be subclass-safe
also for cases that a signature is given (i.e., when creating a ``gufunc``):
the output class will be the same as that returned by the first call to
the underlying function.
