`numpy.delete` no longer ignores out-of-bounds indices
------------------------------------------------------
This concludes deprecations from 1.8 and 1.9, where ``np.delete`` would ignore
both negative and out-of-bounds items in a sequence of indices. This was at
odds with its behavior when passed a single index.

Now out-of-bounds items throw ``IndexError``, and negative items index from the
end.
