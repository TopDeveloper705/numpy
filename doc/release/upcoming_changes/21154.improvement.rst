Math C library feature detection now works for wasm
---------------------------------------------------
The previous feature detection generated C stubs like: 

.. code-block:: C

    void exp(void); // incorrect signature!
    exp();
    
Then checked whether compiling and linking these worked. This generates warnings
that complain that ``exp`` actually has signature ``double exp(double)`` but would
otherwise work. However ``wasm-ld`` creates a hard error in this case, so when
compiling to a wasm target everything is detected as missing.

This is now fixed: we feature detect instead with code like:

.. code-block:: C

    double exp(double); // correct signature!
    exp((double)0);

which ``wasm-ld`` will link. As a side effect, the feature detection code now
works without generating linker warnings.
