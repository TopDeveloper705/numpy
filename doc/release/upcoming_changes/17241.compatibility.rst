The first element of the ``__array_interface__["data"]`` tuple  must be an integer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This has been the documented interface for many years, but there was still
code that would accept a byte string representation of the pointer address.
That code has been removed, passing the address as a byte string will now
raise an error.
