NumPy is now typed
------------------
Type annotations have been added for large parts of NumPy. There is
also a new `numpy.typing` module that contains useful types for
end-users. The currently available types are

- ``ArrayLike``: for objects that can be coerced to an array
- ``DtypeLike``: for objects that can be coerced to a dtype
