Passing boolean ``kth`` values to (arg-)partition has been deprecated
---------------------------------------------------------------------
`~numpy.partition` and `~numpy.argpartition` would previously accept boolean
values for the ``kth`` parameter, which would subsequently be converted into
integers. This behavior has now been deprecated.
