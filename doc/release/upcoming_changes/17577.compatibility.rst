poly1d respects the dtype of all-zero argument
----------------------------------------------
Previously, constructing an instance of ``poly1d`` with all-zero
coefficients would cast the coefficients to ``np.float64``.
This affected the output dtype of methods which construct
``poly1d`` instances internally, such as ``np.polymul``.
