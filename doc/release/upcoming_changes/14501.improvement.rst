`numpy.random.randint` produced incorrect value when the range was ``2**32``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The implementation introduced in 1.17.0 had an incorrect check when
determining whether to use the 32-bit path or the full 64-bit
path that incorrectly redirected random integer generation with a high - low
range of ``2**32`` to the 64-bit generator.
