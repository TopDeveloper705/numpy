BLAS and LAPACK configuration via environment variables
-------------------------------------------------------
Autodetection of installed BLAS and LAPACK libraries can be bypassed by using
the ``NPY_BLAS_LIBS`` and ``NPY_LAPACK_LIBS`` environment variables. Instead,
the link flags in these environment variables will be used directly, and the
language is assumed to be F77.  This is especially useful in automated builds
where the BLAS and LAPACK that are installed are known exactly.  A use case is
replacing the actual implementation at runtime via stub library links.

If ``NPY_CBLAS_LIBS`` is set (optional in addition to ``NPY_BLAS_LIBS``), this
will be used as well, by defining ``HAVE_CBLAS`` and appending the environment
variable content to the link flags.
