Improve performance of ``np.save`` and ``np.load`` for small arrays
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``np.save`` is now a lot faster for small arrays.

``np.load`` is also faster for small arrays,
but only when serializing with a version >= `(3, 0)`.

Both are done by removing checks that are only relevant for Python 2,
while still maintaining compatibility with arrays
which might have been created by Python 2.
