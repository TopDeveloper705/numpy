* The deprecation of numeric style type-codes ``np.dtype("Complex64")``
  (with upper case spelling), is expired.  ``"Complex64"`` corresponded to
  ``"complex128"`` and ``"Complex32"`` corresponded to ``"complex64"``.
* The deprecation of ``np.sctypeNA`` and ``np.typeNA`` is expired. Both
  have been removed from the public API. Use ``np.typeDict`` instead.
