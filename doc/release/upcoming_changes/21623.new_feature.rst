New parameter ``equal_nan`` added to `np.unique`
------------------------------------------------

`np.unique` was changed in 1.21 to treat all ``NaN`` values as equal and return
a single ``NaN``. Setting ``equal_nan=False`` will restore pre-1.21 behavior
to treat ``NaNs`` as unique. Defaults to ``True``.
