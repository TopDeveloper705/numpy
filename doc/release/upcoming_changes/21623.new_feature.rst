New parameter ``equal_nans`` added to `np.unique`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`np.unique` was previously changed to treat NaN values as equal. Now this functionality is decided by setting the ``equal_nans`` kwarg to True or False. True is the default behavior.
