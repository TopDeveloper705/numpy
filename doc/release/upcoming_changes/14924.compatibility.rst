Changed random variate stream from `numpy.random.Generator.dirichlet`
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A bug in the generation of random variates for the Dirichlet distribution
with small `alpha` values was fixed by using a different algorithm when
``max(alpha) < 0.1``.  Because of the change, the stream of variates
generated by `dirichlet` in this case will be different from previous
releases.
