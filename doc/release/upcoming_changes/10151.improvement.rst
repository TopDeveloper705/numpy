Different C numeric types of the same size have unique names
------------------------------------------------------------
On any given platform, two of ``np.intc``, ``np.int_``, and ``np.longlong``
would previously appear indistinguishable through their ``repr``, despite
their corresponding ``dtype`` having different properties.
A similar problem existed for the unsigned counterparts to these types, and on
some platforms for ``np.double`` and ``np.longdouble``

These types now always print with a unique ``__name__``.
