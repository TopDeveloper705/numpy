Different C numeric types of the same size have unique names
------------------------------------------------------------
On any given platform, two of ``np.intc``, ``np.int_``, and ``np.longlong``
would previously appear indistinguishable through their ``repr``, despite
having different properties when wrapped into ``dtype``s.
A similar problem existed for the unsigned counterparts to these types, and on
some plaforms for ``np.double`` and ``np.longdouble``

These types now always print with a unique ``__name__``.
