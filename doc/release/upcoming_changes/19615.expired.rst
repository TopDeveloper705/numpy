Expired deprecations for ``loads``, ``ndfromtxt``, and ``mafromtxt`` in npyio
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``numpy.loads`` was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that users
use `pickle.loads` instead.
``ndfromtxt`` and ``mafromtxt`` were both deprecated in v1.17 - users should
use `numpy.genfromtxt` instead with the appropriate value for the
``usemask`` parameter.
