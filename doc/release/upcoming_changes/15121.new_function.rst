The random.Generator class has a new ``permuted`` function.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The new function differs from ``shuffle`` and ``permutation`` in that the
subarrays indexed by an axis are permuted rather than the axis being treated as
a separate 1-D array for every combination of the other indexes. For example,
it is now possible to permute the rows or columns of a 2-D array.
