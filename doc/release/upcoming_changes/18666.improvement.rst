``Generator.rayleigh`` and ``Generator.geometric`` performance improved
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The performance of Rayleigh and geometric random variate generation
in ``Generator`` has improved. These are both transformation of exponential
random variables and the slow log-based inverse cdf transformation has
been replaced with the Ziggurat-based exponential variate generator.

This change breaks the stream of variates generated  when variates from
either of these distributions are produced.
