Add `PCG64DXSM` `BitGenerator`
------------------------------

Uses of the `PCG64` `BitGenerator` in a massively-parallel context have been
shown to have statistical weaknesses that were not apparent at the first
release in numpy 1.17. Most users will never observe this weakness and are
safe to continue to use `PCG64`. We have introduced a new `PCG64DXSM`
`BitGenerator` that will eventually become the new default `BitGenerator`
implementation used by `default_rng` in future releases. `PCG64DXSM` solves
the statistical weakness while preserving the performance and the features of
`PCG64`.

See :ref:`upgrading-pcg64` for more details.
