Improve detection of CPU features
=================================

Replace ``npy_cpu_supports`` which was a gcc-specific mechanism to test support
of avx with more general functions ``npy_cpu_init`` and ``npy_cpu_have``, and
expose the results via a ``NPY_CPU_HAVE`` c-macro as well as a python-level
``__cpu_features__`` dictionary.
