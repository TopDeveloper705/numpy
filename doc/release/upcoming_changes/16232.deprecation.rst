``outer`` and ``ufunc.outer`` deprecated for matrix
---------------------------------------------------
``np.matrix`` use with `~numpy.outer` or generic ufunc outer
calls such as ``numpy.add.outer``. Previously, matrix was
converted to an array here. This will not be done in the future
requiring a manual conversion to arrays.
