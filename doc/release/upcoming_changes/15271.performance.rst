Reduced call overheads with keyword arguments
---------------------------------------------
In the following cases NumPy now has a much reduced call
overhead:

* The array creation functions ``np.asarray``,
  ``np.asanyarray``, ``np.ascontiguousarray``, and
  ``np.asfortranarray``.  These are now always as fast
  as ``np.array`` itself.
* Universal functions (partially limited to Python 3.8+).
* Many NumPy array methods when keyword arguments are used.

This can lead to large performance improvements for some
function calls when working with small arrays.
For functions improved here, the use of keyword arguments
will only have a minimal performance impact.
