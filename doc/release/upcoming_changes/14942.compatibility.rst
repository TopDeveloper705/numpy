Fasttake and fastputmask slots are deprecated and NULL'ed
---------------------------------------------------------
The fasttake and fastputmask slots are now never used internally.
They will always set to NULL for builtin dtypes.
No downstream project should be using these, so no compatibility
issue are expected.
