Fasttake and fastputmask slots are deprecated and NULL'ed
---------------------------------------------------------
The fasttake and fastputmask slots are now never used and
must always be set to NULL. This will result in no change in behaviour.
However, if a user dtype should set one of these a DeprecationWarning
will be given.
