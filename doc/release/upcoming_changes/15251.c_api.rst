Better support for ``const`` dimensions in API functions
--------------------------------------------------------
The following functions now accept a constant array of ``npy_intp``:

* `PyArray_BroadcastToShape`
* `PyArray_IntTupleFromIntp`
* `PyArray_OverflowMultiplyList`

Previously the caller would have to cast away the const-ness to call these
functions.
