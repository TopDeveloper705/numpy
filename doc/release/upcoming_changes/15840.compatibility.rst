Change output of ``round`` on scalars to be consistent with Python
------------------------------------------------------------------

Output of the ``__round__`` dunder method and consequently the Python
built-in `round` has been changed to be a Python `int` to be consistent
with calling it on Python ``float`` objects when called with no arguments.
Previously, it would return a scalar of the `np.dtype` that was passed in.
