Digitize Keyword Egde
---------------------
A keyword argument has been added to `np.digitize` so that the
edge case is covered in the last bin. For example,

```
x = [1, 2, 3]
bins = [0, 1.5, 3]
```

`np.digitize(x, bins, right=False, edge=True)` yields `[1, 2, 2]`
whereas before the edge keyword argument existed it would yield
`[1, 2, 3]`.
