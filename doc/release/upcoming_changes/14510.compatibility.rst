`numpy.lib.recfunctions.drop_fields` can no longer return `None`
----------------------------------------------------------------
If ``drop_fields`` is used to drop all fields, previously the array would
be completely discarded and `None` returned. Now it returns an array of the
same shape as the input, but with no fields. The old behavior can be retained
with::

    dropped_arr = drop_fields(arr, ['a', 'b'])
    if dropped_arr.dtype.names == ():
        dropped_arr = None

converting the empty recarray to `None`
