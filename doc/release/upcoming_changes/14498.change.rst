Remove ``numpy.random.entropy`` without a deprecation
-----------------------------------------------------

``numpy.random.entropy`` was added to the `numpy.random` namespace in 1.17.0.
It was meant to be a private c-extension module, but was exposed as public.
It has been replaced by `numpy.random.SeedSequence` so the module was
completely removed.
