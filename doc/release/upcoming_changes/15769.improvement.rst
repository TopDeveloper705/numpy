Ability to disable madvise hugepages
------------------------------------

On Linux NumPy has previously added support for madavise
hugepages which can improve performance for very large arrays.
Unfortunately, on older Kernel versions this led to peformance
regressions, thus by default the support has been disabled on
kernels before version 4.6. To override the default, you can
use the environment variable::

    NUMPY_MADVISE_HUGEPAGE=0

or set it to 1 to force enabling support. Note that this only makes
a difference if the operating system is set up to use madvise
transparent hugepage.
