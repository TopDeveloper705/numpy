Size of ``np.ndarray`` and ``np.void_`` changed
-----------------------------------------------
The size of the ``PyArrayObject`` and ``PyVoidScalarObject``
structures have changed.  The following header definition has been
removed::

    #define NPY_SIZEOF_PYARRAYOBJECT (sizeof(PyArrayObject_fields))

since the size must not be considered a compile time constant: it will
change for different runtime versions of NumPy.

The most likely relevant use are potential subclasses written in C which
will have to be recompiled and should be updated.  Please see the
documentation for :c:type:`PyArrayObject` for more details and contact
the NumPy developers if you are affected by this change.

NumPy will attempt to give a graceful error but a program expecting a
fixed structure size may have undefined behaviour and likely crash.
