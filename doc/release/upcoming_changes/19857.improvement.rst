Add new methods for ``quantile`` and ``percentile``
---------------------------------------------------

``quantile`` and ``percentile`` now have have a ``method=``
keyword argument supporting 13 different methods.
This replaces the ``interpolation=`` keyword argument.

The methods are now aligned with nine methods which can be
found in scientific literature and the R language.
The remaining methods are the previous discontinuous variations
of the default "linear" one.

Please see the documentation of `numpy.percentile` for more information.
