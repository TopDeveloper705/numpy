Add new linear interpolation methods for ``quantile`` and ``percentile``
------------------------------------------------------------------------

``quantile`` and ``percentile`` now have 13 linear interpolation methods,
nine of which can be found in the scientific literature.
The remaining methods are NumPy specific and are kept for backwards
compatibility. The default is "inclusive" (method 7), whose behavior is equivalent
to the former default "linear".
