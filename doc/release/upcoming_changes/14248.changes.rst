numpy.distutils: append behavior changed for LDFLAGS and similar
----------------------------------------------------------------
`numpy.distutils` has always overridden rather than appended to `LDFLAGS` and
other similar such environment variables for compiling Fortran extensions. Now
the default behavior has changed to appending - which is the expected behavior
in most situations.  To preserve the old (overwriting) behavior, set the
`NPY_DISTUTILS_APPEND_FLAGS` environment variable to 0.  This applies to:
`LDFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`, `F90FLAGS`, `FREEFLAGS`, `FOPT`, `FDEBUG`, and `FFLAGS`.
NumPy 1.16 and 1.17 gave build warnings in situations where this change in
behavior would have affected the compile flags used.
