Passing ``shape=0`` to factory functions in ``numpy.rec`` is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

``0`` is treated as a special case and is aliased to ``None`` in the functions: 

* `numpy.core.records.fromarrays`
* `numpy.core.records.fromrecords`
* `numpy.core.records.fromstring`
* `numpy.core.records.fromfile`

In future, ``0`` will not be special cased, and will be treated as an array
length like any other integer.
