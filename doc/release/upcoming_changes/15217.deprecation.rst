Passing ``shape=0`` to factory functions in ``numpy.rec`` is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

``0`` is treated as a special case by these functions, which aliases to
``None``. In future, ``0`` will not be a special case, and will be treated
as an array length like any other integer is. The affected functions are:

* `numpy.core.records.fromarrays`
* `numpy.core.records.fromrecords`
* `numpy.core.records.fromstring`
* `numpy.core.records.fromfile`
