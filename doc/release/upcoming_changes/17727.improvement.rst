Improved performance in integer division of NumPy arrays
--------------------------------------------------------
Integer division of NumPy arrays now uses libdivide.
With builtin support for SSE2, AVX2 and AVX512 vector 
division from libdivide and other minor improvements, 
there is a large speedup.
The ``//`` operator and ``np.floor_divide`` makes use
of the new changes.
