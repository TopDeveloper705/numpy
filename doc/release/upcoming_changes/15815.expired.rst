`numpy.delete` no longer casts boolean indices to integers
----------------------------------------------------------
This concludes a deprecation from 1.8, where ``np.delete`` would cast boolean
arrays and scalars passed as an index argument into integer indices. The
behavior now is to treat boolean arrays as a mask, and to raise an error
on boolean scalars.
