New attribute ``symbol`` added to polynomial classes
----------------------------------------------------

The polynomial classes in the ``numpy.polynomial`` package have a new
``symbol`` attribute which is used to represent the indeterminate
of the polynomial.
This can be used to change the value of the variable when printing::

    >>> P_y = np.polynomial.Polynomial([1, 0, -1], symbol="y")
    >>> print(P_y)
    1.0 + 0.0·y¹ - 1.0·y²

Note that the polynomial classes only support 1D polynomials, so operations
that involve polynomials with different symbols are disallowed when the
result would be multivariate::

    >>> P = np.polynomial.Polynomial([1, -1])  # default symbol is "x"
    >>> P_z = np.polynomial.Polynomial([1, 1], symbol="z")
    >>> P * P_z
    Traceback (most recent call last)
       ...
    ValueError: Polynomial symbols differ

The symbol can be any valid Python identifier. The default is ``symbol=x``,
consistent with existing behavior.
