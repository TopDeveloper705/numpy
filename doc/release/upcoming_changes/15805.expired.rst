`numpy.insert` and `numpy.delete` no longer accept non-integral indices
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This concludes a deprecation from 1.9, where sequences of non-integers indices
were allowed and cast to integers. Now passing sequences of non-integral
indices raises ``IndexError``, just like it does when passing a single
non-integral scalar.
