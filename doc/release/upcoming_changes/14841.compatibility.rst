Add more ufunc loops for ``datetime64``, ``timedelta64``
--------------------------------------------------------
``np.datetime('NaT')`` should behave more like ``float('Nan')``. Add needed
infrastructure so ``np.isinf(a)`` and ``np.isnan(a)`` will run on
``datetime64`` and ``timedelta64`` dtypes. Also added specific loops for
`numpy.fmin` and `numpy.fmax` that mask ``NaT``. This may require adjustment to user-
facing code. Specifically, code that either disallowed the calls to
`numpy.isinf` or `numpy.isnan` or checked that they raised an exception will
require adaptation, and code that mistakenly called `numpy.fmax` and
`numpy.fmin` instead of `numpy.maximum` or `numpy.minimum` respectively will
requre adjustment. This also affects `numpy.nanmax` and `numpy.nanmin`.
