``where`` keyword argument for ``numpy.all`` and ``numpy.any`` functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The keyword argument ``where`` is added and allows to only consider specified
elements or subaxes from an array in the Boolean evaluation of ``all`` and
``any``. This new keyword is available to the functions ``all`` and ``any``
both via ``numpy`` directly or in the methods of ``numpy.ndarray``.

Any broadcastable Boolean array or a scalar can be set as ``where``. It
defaults to ``True`` to evaluate the functions for all elements in an array if
``where`` is not set by the user. Examples are given in the documentation of
the functions.


``where`` keyword argument for ``numpy`` functions ``mean``, ``std``, ``var``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The keyword argument ``where`` is added and allows to limit the scope in the
caluclation of ``mean``, ``std`` and ``var`` to only a subset of elements. It
is available both via ``numpy`` directly or in the methods of
``numpy.ndarray``.

Any broadcastable Boolean array or a scalar can be set as ``where``. It
defaults to ``True`` to evaluate the functions for all elements in an array if
``where`` is not set by the user. Examples are given in the documentation of
the functions.
