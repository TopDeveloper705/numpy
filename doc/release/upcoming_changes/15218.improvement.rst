Use 64-bit integer size on 64-bit platforms in fallback lapack_lite
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use 64-bit integer size on 64-bit platforms in the fallback LAPACK library,
which is used when the system has no LAPACK installed, allowing it to deal with
linear algebra for large arrays.
