The files ``numpy/testing/decorators.py``, ``numpy/testing/noseclasses.py``
and ``numpy/testing/nosetester.py`` have been removed.  They were never
meant to be public (all relevant objects are present in the
``numpy.testing`` namespace), and importing them has given a deprecation
warning since NumPy 1.15.0
