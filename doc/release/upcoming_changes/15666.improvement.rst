Improved string representation for polynomials (__str__)
--------------------------------------------------------

The string representation (``__str__``) of all six polynomial types in
`numpy.polynomial` has been updated to give the polynomial as a mathematical
expression instead of an array of coefficients. Two package-wide formats for
the polynomial expressions are available - one using Unicode characters for
superscripts and subscripts, and another using only ASCII characters.
