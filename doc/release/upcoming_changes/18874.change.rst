Enable Accelerate Framework
----------------------------
With the release of macOS 11.3, several different issues that
numpy was encountering when using Accelerate Framework's
implementation of BLAS and LAPACK should be resolved.  This
change enables the Accelerate Framework as an option on macOS.
If additional issues are found, please file a bug report
against Accelerate using the developer feedback assistant
tool (https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/). We
intend to address issues promptly and plan to continue
supporting and updating our BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
