Changes to comparisons with ``dtype=...``
-----------------------------------------
When the ``dtype=`` (or ``signature``) arguments to comparison
ufuncs (``equal``, ``less``, etc.) is used, this will denote
the desired output dtype in the future.
This means that:

    np.equal(2, 3, dtype=object)

will give a ``FutureWarning`` that it will return an ``object``
array in the future, which currently happens for:

    np.equal(None, None, dtype=object)

due to the fact that ``np.array(None)`` is already an object
array. (This also happens for some other dtypes.)

Since comparisons normally only return boolean arrays, providing
any other dtype will always raise an error in the future and
give a ``DeprecationWarning`` now.


Changes to ``dtype`` and ``signature`` arguments in ufuncs
----------------------------------------------------------
The universal function arguments ``dtype`` and ``signature``
which are also valid for reduction such as ``np.add.reduce``
(which is the implementation for ``np.sum``) will now issue
a warning when the ``dtype`` provided is not a "basic" dtype.

NumPy almost always ignored metadata, byteorder or time units
on these inputs.  NumPy will now always ignore it and issue
a warning if byteorder or time unit changed.
The following are the most important examples of changes which
will issue the warning and in some cases previously returned
different results::

    # The following will now warn on most systems (unchanged result):
    np.add(3, 5, dtype=">i32")

    # The biggest impact is for timedelta or datetimes:
    arr = np.arange(10, dtype="m8[s]")
    # The examples always ignored the time unit "ns" (using the
    # unit of `arr`.  They now issue a warning:
    np.add(arr, arr, dtype="m8[ns]")
    np.maximum.reduce(arr, dtype="m8[ns]")

    # The following issue a warning but previously did return
    # a "ns" result.
    np.add(3, 5, dtype="m8[ns]")  # Now return generic time units
    np.maximum(arr, arr, dtype="m8[ns]")  # Now returns "s" (from `arr`)

The same applies for functions like ``np.sum`` which use these internally.
This change is necessary to achieve consistent handling within NumPy.
