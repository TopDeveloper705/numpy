``issubdtype`` no longer interprets ``float`` as ``np.floating``
----------------------------------------------------------------

`numpy.issubdtype` had a FutureWarning since NumPy 1.14 which
has expired now. This means that certain input where the second
argument was neither a datatype nor a NumPy scalar type
(such as a string or a python type like ``int`` or ``float``)
will now be consistent with passing in ``np.dtype(arg2).type``.
This makes the result consistent with expectations and leads to
a false result in some cases which previously returned true.
