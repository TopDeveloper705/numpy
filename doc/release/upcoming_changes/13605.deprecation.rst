`np.fromfile` and `np.fromstring` will error on bad data
--------------------------------------------------------

In future numpy releases, the functions `np.fromfile` and `np.fromstring`
will throw an error when parsing bad data.
This will now give a ``DeprecationWarning`` where previously partial or
even invalid data was silently returned. This deprecation also affects
the C defined functions c:func:`PyArray_FromString`` and
c:func:`PyArray_FromFile`
