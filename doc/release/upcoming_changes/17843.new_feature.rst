Added a mypy plugin for handling platform-specific `numpy.number` precisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mypy_ plugin is now available for automatically assigning the (platform-dependent)
precisions of certain `~numpy.number` subclasses, including the likes of
`~numpy.int_`, `~numpy.intp` and `~numpy.longlong`. See the documentation on
:ref:`scalar types <arrays.scalars.built-in>` for a comprehensive overview
of the affected classes.

Note that while usage of the plugin is completely optional, without it the
precision of above-mentioned classes will be inferred as `~typing.Any`.

To enable the plugin, one must add it to their mypy `configuration file`_:

.. code-block:: ini

    [mypy]
    plugins = numpy.typing.mypy_plugin


.. _mypy: http://mypy-lang.org/
.. _configuration file: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html
