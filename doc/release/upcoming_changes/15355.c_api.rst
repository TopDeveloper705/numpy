Const qualify UFunc inner loops
-------------------------------
``UFuncGenericFunction`` now expects pointers to const ``dimension`` and
``strides`` as arguments. This means inner loops may no longer modify
either ``dimension`` or ``strides``. This change leads to an
``incompatible-pointer-types`` warning forcing users to either ignore
the compiler warnings or to const qualify their own loop signatures.
