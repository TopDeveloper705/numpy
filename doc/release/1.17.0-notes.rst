Improvements
============

replacement of the `fftpack`-based FFT module by the `pocketfft` library
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both implementations have the same ancestor (Fortran77 `FFTPACK` by Paul N.
Swarztrauber), but `pocketfft` contains additional modifications which
improve both accuracy and performance in some circumstances. For FFT lengths
containing large prime factors, `pocketfft` uses Bluestein's algorithm, which
maintains `O(N log N)` run time complexity instead of deteriorating towards
`O(N*N)` for prime lengths. Also, accuracy for real-valued FFTs with near-prime
lengths has improved and is on par with complex-valued FFTs.
