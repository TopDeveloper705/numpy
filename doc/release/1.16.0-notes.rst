Comparison ufuncs will now error rather than return NotImplemented
------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, comparison ufuncs such as ``np.equal`` would return
`NotImplemented` if their arguments had structured dtypes, to help comparison
operators such as ``__eq__`` deal with those.  This is no longer needed, as the
relevant logic has moved to the comparison operators proper (which thus do
continue to return `NotImplemented` as needed). Hence, like all other ufuncs,
the comparison ufuncs will now error on structured dtypes.
