Abstract
--------

This NEP recommends and encourages all projects across the Scientific Python ecosystem to adopt a common "time window-based" policy for support of Python and NumPy versions. Standardizing a recommendation for project support of minimum Python and NumPy versions will improve downstream project planning.
based policy for increasing the minimum version of Python and NumPy
that downstream projects support.  By standardizing this policy
across the community we will make it easier for downstream projects to
plan.

This is an unusual NEP in that it offers recommendations for
community-wide policy and not for changes to NumPy itself.  Since a
common place for SPEEPs (Scientific Python Ecosystem Enhancement
Proposals) does not exist and given NumPy's central role in the
ecosystem, a NEP provides a visible place to document the proposed
policy.

This NEP is being put forward by maintainers of Matplotlib, scikit-learn,
IPython, Jupyter, yt, SciPy, NumPy, and scikit-image.



Detailed description
--------------------

For the purposes of this NEP we assume semantic versioning and define:

*major version*
   A release that change the first number (e.g. X.0.0)

*minor version*
   A release that changes the second number (e.g x.Y.0)

*patch version*
   A release that changes the third number (e.g. x.y.Z)


When a project creates a new major or minor version, we recommend that
the project should support all minor versions of ``Python`` introduced
and released in the prior 42 months ~~from their anticipated release
date~~ and all minor versions of NumPy released in the prior 24
months.


The diagram::

       Jan 16      Jan 17      Jan 18      Jan 19      Jan 20
       |           |           |           |           |
  +++++|+++++++++++|+++++++++++|+++++++++++|+++++++++++|++++++++++++
   |              |                  |               |
   py 3.5.0       py 3.6.0           py 3.7.0        py 3.8.0
  |-----------------------------------------> Feb19
            |-----------------------------------------> Dec19
                      |-----------------------------------------> Nov20

shows the 42 month support windows for ``Python``.  A project with a
major or minor version release in Feb19 should support py35 and newer,
a project with a major or minor version release in Dec19 should
support py36 and newer, and a project with a major or minor version
release in Nov20 should support py37 and newer.

The current Python release cadence is 18 months so a 42 month window
ensures that there will always be at least two versions of ``Python``
in the window.  By padding the window by 6 months from the anticipated
``Python`` cadence we avoid the edge cases where a project releases
the month after ``Python`` and would effectively only support one
version of ``Python`` that has an installed base.
This six month buffer provides resilience to minor fluctuations /
delays in the ``Python`` release schedule.

Because ``Python`` version support is based
on historical release dates, a 42 month time window, and a project's plans, a project can decide to drop
a given version of ``Python`` very early in
the release process.

While there will be some unavoidable mismatch in supported version of
``Python`` between if a project release occurs immediately after a version of
``Python`` ages out.  This should not last longer than one
release cycle of each of the projects, and when a given project
does a minor or major release, it is guaranteed that there will be a
stable release of all other projects that support the set of
``Python`` the new release will support.

If there is a Python 4 this policy will have to be reviewed in light
of the community's and projects' best interests.


Implementation
--------------

We suggest that all projects adopt the following language into their
development guidelines:


   - This project supports minor versions of ``Python`` initially released
     42 months prior to a planned project release date.
   - The project will always support at least the 2 latest minor versions of ``Python``
   - support minor versions of ``numpy`` initially released in the 24
     months prior to a planned project release date or the oldest version that supports the
     minimum Python version (whichever is higher)

   The minimum supported version of ``Python`` will be set to
   ``python_requires`` in ``setup``.  All supported versions of
   Python will be in the test matrix and have binary artifacts built
   for releases.

   The project will bump (adjust upward) the minimum Python and NumPy version support on
   every minor and major release, but never on a patch release.

For other dependencies, adopt similar time windows of 24 months or
shorter.


Backward compatibility
----------------------

No backward compatibility issues.

Alternatives
------------

Ad-Hoc
~~~~~~

A project could on every release evaluate whether to increase
the minimum version of Python supported.
As a major downside, an ad-hoc approach makes it hard for downstream users to predict what
the future minimum versions will be.  As there is no objective threshold
to when the minimum version should be dropped, it is easy for these
version support discussions to devolve into [bike shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_Parkinson%27s_bicycle-shed_effect) and acrimony.


All CPython supported versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CPython supported versions of Python are listed in the Python
Developers Guide and the Python PEPs. Supporting these are a very
clear and conservative approach.  However, it means that there is 4
year lag between when new language features come into the language and
when the projects are able to use them.  Additionally, for projects
that have a significant component of compiled extensions this requires
building many binary artifacts for each release.

For the case of NumPy, many projects carry workarounds to bugs that
are fixed in subsequent versions of NumPy.  Being proactive about
increasing the minimum version of NumPy will allow downstream
packages to carry fewer version-specific patches.



Default version on Linux distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The policy could be to support the version of Python that ships by
default in the latest Ubuntu LTS or CentOS/RHEL release.  However, we
would still have to standardize across the community which
distribution we are following.

By following the versions supported by major Linux distributions, we
are giving up technical control of our projects to external
organizations that may have different motivations and concerns than we
do.

N minor versions of Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the current release cadence of the Python, the proposed time
(42 months) is roughly equivalent to "the last two" Python minor
versions.  However, if Python changes their release cadence, any rule
based on the number of minor releases will need to be changed.


Time window on the X.Y.1 Python release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the first bug fix release is typically a few months after the
initial release, you can achieve the same effect by using a large delay
from the X.Y.0 release which seems simpler to explain.
