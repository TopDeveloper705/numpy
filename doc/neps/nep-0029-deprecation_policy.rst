Abstract
--------

This NEP recommends and encourages all projects across the Scientific
Python ecosystem to adopt a common "time window-based" policy for
support of Python and NumPy versions. Standardizing a recommendation
for project support of minimum Python and NumPy versions will improve
downstream project planning.

This is an unusual NEP in that it offers recommendations for
community-wide policy and not for changes to NumPy itself.  Since a
common place for SPEEPs (Scientific Python Ecosystem Enhancement
Proposals) does not exist and given NumPy's central role in the
ecosystem, a NEP provides a visible place to document the proposed
policy.

This NEP is being put forward by maintainers of Matplotlib, scikit-learn,
IPython, Jupyter, yt, SciPy, NumPy, and scikit-image.



Detailed description
--------------------

For the purposes of this NEP we assume semantic versioning and define:

*major version*
   A release that change the first number (e.g. X.0.0)

*minor version*
   A release that changes the second number (e.g x.Y.0)

*patch version*
   A release that changes the third number (e.g. x.y.Z)


When a project creates a new major or minor version, we recommend that
the project should support at least all minor versions of Python
introduced and released in the prior 42 months ~~from their
anticipated release date~~ with a minimum of 2 minor versions of
Python, and all minor versions of NumPy released in the prior 24
months ~~from their anticipated release date~~ with a minimum of 3
minor versions of NumPy.

  |-----------------------------------------> Feb19
            |-----------------------------------------> Dec19
                      |-----------------------------------------> Nov20

shows the 42 month support windows for Python.  A project with a
major or minor version release in Feb19 should support py35 and newer,
a project with a major or minor version release in Dec19 should
support py36 and newer, and a project with a major or minor version
release in Nov20 should support py37 and newer.

The current Python release cadence is 18 months so a 42 month window
ensures that there will always be at least two minor versions of Python
in the window.  By padding the window by 6 months from the anticipated
Python cadence we avoid the edge cases where a project releases
the month after Python and would effectively only support one
minor version of Python that has an installed base.
This six month buffer provides resilience to minor fluctuations /
delays in the Python release schedule.

Because Python minor version support is based on historical release
dates, a 36 month time window, and a project's plans, a project can
decide to drop a given minor version of Python very early in the release
process.

While there will be some unavoidable mismatch in supported versions of
Python between projects if releases occurs immediately after a
minor version of Python ages out.  This should not last longer than one
release cycle of each of the projects, and when a given project does a
minor or major release, it is guaranteed that there will be a stable
release of all other projects that support the set of Python the
new release will support.

If there is a Python 4 or a NumPy 2 this policy will have to be
reviewed in light of the community's and projects' best interests.

Implementation
--------------

We suggest that all projects adopt the following language into their
development guidelines:


   - This project supports at least the minor versions of Python
     initially released 42 months prior to a planned project release
     date.
   - The project will always support at least the 2 latest minor
     versions of Python.
   - The project will support minor versions of ``numpy`` initially
     released in the 24 months prior to a planned project release date
     or the oldest version that supports the minimum Python version
     (whichever is higher).
   - The project will always support at least the 3 latest minor
     versions of NumPy.

   The minimum supported version of Python will be set to
   ``python_requires`` in ``setup``.  All supported minor versions of
   Python will be in the test matrix and have binary artifacts built
   for releases.

   The project should adjust upward the minimum Python and NumPy
   version support on every minor and major release, but never on a
   patch release.


Backward compatibility
----------------------

No backward compatibility issues.

Alternatives
------------

Ad-Hoc version support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A project could on every release evaluate whether to increase
the minimum version of Python supported.
As a major downside, an ad-hoc approach makes it hard for downstream users to predict what
the future minimum versions will be.  As there is no objective threshold
to when the minimum version should be dropped, it is easy for these
version support discussions to devolve into [bike shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_Parkinson%27s_bicycle-shed_effect) and acrimony.


All CPython supported versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CPython supported versions of Python are listed in the Python
Developers Guide and the Python PEPs. Supporting these is a very
clear and conservative approach.  However, it means that there is 4
year lag between when new language features come into the language and
when the projects are able to use them.  Additionally, for projects
that have a significant component of compiled extensions this requires
building many binary artifacts for each release.

For the case of NumPy, many projects carry workarounds to bugs that
are fixed in subsequent versions of NumPy.  Being proactive about
increasing the minimum version of NumPy will allow downstream
packages to carry fewer version-specific patches.



Default version on Linux distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The policy could be to support the version of Python that ships by
default in the latest Ubuntu LTS or CentOS/RHEL release.  However, we
would still have to standardize across the community which
distribution we are following.

By following the versions supported by major Linux distributions, we
are giving up technical control of our projects to external
organizations that may have different motivations and concerns than we
do.

N minor versions of Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the current release cadence of the Python, the proposed time (42
months) is roughly equivalent to "the last two" Python minor versions.
However, if Python changes their release cadence substantially, any
rule based solely on the number of minor releases may need to be
changed to remain sensible.

A more fundamental problem with a policy based on number of Python
releases is that it is hard to predict when support for a given minor
version of Python will be dropped as that requires correctly
predicting the release schedule of Python for the next 3-4 years.  A
time-based rule is only depends on things that have already happened
and the length of the support window.




Time window from the X.Y.1 Python release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is equivalent to a few month longer support window from the X.Y.0
release.  This is because X.Y.1 bug-fix release is typically a few
months after the X.Y.0 release, thus a N month window from X.Y.1 is
roughly equivalent to a N+3 month from X.Y.0.

The X.Y.0 release is naturally a special release.  If we were to
anchor the window on X.Y.1 we would then have the discussion of why
not X.Y.M?
