Abstract
--------

All projects across the ecosystem should adopt a common time window
based policy for increasing the minimum version of Python and numpy
that down stream projects support.  By standardizing this policy
across community we will make it easier for down stream projects to
plan.



Detailed description
--------------------

When making a new major or minor release, projects should support all
minor versions of ``CPython`` initially released in the prior 40
months from their anticipated release date and all minor version of
``numpy`` release in the prior 24 months.


The diagram::

       Jan 16       Jan 17       Jan 18       Jan 19       Jan 20
       |            |            |            |            |
  +++++|++++++++++++|++++++++++++|++++++++++++|++++++++++++|++++++++++++
   |               |                   |                |
   py 3.5.0        py 3.6.0            py 3.7.0         py 3.8.0
        |---------------------------------------> Feb19
                 |----------------------------------------> Dec19
                        |----------------------------------------> Jul20

shows the support windows for ``CPython``.  A project with a minor
release in Feb19 or Dec19 should support py36 or newer whereas a
project released in Jul20 should support py37 and newer.

The current CPython release cadence is 18mo so a 40 month window
ensures that there will always be at least two versions of ``CPython``
in the window.  By padding the window by 4 months from the anticipated
``CPython`` cadence we avoid the edge cases where a project releases
the month after ``CPython`` and would effectively only support one
version of ``CPython`` that has an install base.  This buffer
also makes us resilient to minor fluctuations / delays in the
``CPython`` release schedule.

Because the threshold for dropping a version of ``CPython`` is based
on historical release dates and a project's plans, the decision to drop
support for a given version of ``CPython`` can be made very early in
the release process.

There will be some unavoidable miss match in supported version of
``CPython`` between packages immediately after a version of
``CPython`` ages out.  However this should not last longer that one
release cycle of each of the projects and when a given project
does a minor or major release, it is guaranteed that there will be a
stable release of all other projects that support the set of
``CPython`` the new release will support.


Implementation
--------------

We suggest that all project adopt the following language into their
development guidelines:


   - support minor versions of ``CPython`` initially released
     40 months prior to our planned release date.
   - always support at least the 2 latest versions of ``CPython``.
   - support minor versions of ``numpy`` initially released in the 24
     months prior to our planned release date or oldest that supports the
     minimum python version (which ever is higher)

   We will bump the minimum python and numpy versions as we can on
   every minor and major release, but never on a patch release

For other dependencies adopt similar time windows of the same length
or shorter than 24 months.


Backward compatibility
----------------------

No issues other than the intentional dropping of old version of
``CPython`` and dependencies.


Alternatives
------------

Ad-Hoc
~~~~~~

Projects could on a every release evaluate if they want to increase
the minimum version of python supported.  While this is a notionally
simple policy, it makes it hard for down-stream users to predict what
the future minimum versions will be.  There is no objective threshold
to when the minimum version should be dropped, it is easy for these
discussions to devolve into bike shedding and acrimony.


All PSF supported versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a very clear and conservative approach.  However it means that
there is 4 year lag between when new language features come into the
language and when the projects are able to use them.  Additionally,
for projects that have a significant component of compiled extensions
this requires building many binary artifacts for each release.

For the case of numpy, many projects carry work-arounds to bugs that
are fixed in subsequent versions of numpy.  Being proactive about
increasing the minimum version of numpy will allow down-stream
packages to carry fewer version-specific patches.



Default version on Linux distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The policy could be support the version of python that ships by
default in the latest Ubuntu LTS or CentOS/RHEL release.  However, we
would still have to standardize across the community which
distribution we are following.

By following the versions supported by major linux distributions we
are giving up technical control of our projects to external
organizations that may have different motivations and concerns than we
do.

N minor versions of Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the current release cadence of the CPython, the proposed time
(40 months) is roughly equivalent to "the last two" CPython minor
versions.  However, if CPython changes their release cadence any rule
based on the number of minor releases will need to be changed.


Time window on the X.Y.1 CPython release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can achieve the same name effect by making the window longer which is
easier to explain.
