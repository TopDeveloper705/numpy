# Check permissions and dependencies on installed DLLs
# DLLs need execute permissions to be used
# DLLs must be able to find their dependencies
# This checks both of those, then does a direct test
# The best way of checking whether a C extension module is importable
# is trying to import it.  The rest is trying to give reasons why it
# isn't importing.
#
# One of the tools and the extension for shared libraries are
# Cygwin-specific, but the rest should work on most platforms with
# /bin/sh
