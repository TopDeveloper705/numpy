# 'setuptools', 'wheel' and 'cython' are build dependencies.  This information
# is stored in pyproject.toml, but there is not yet a standard way to install
# those dependencies with, say, a pip command, so we'll just hard-code their
# installation here.  We only need to install them separately for the cases
# where numpy is installed with setup.py, which is the case for the Travis jobs
# where the environment variables USE_DEBUG or USE_WHEEL are set. When pip is
# used to install numpy, pip gets the build dependencies from pyproject.toml.
# A specific version of cython is required, so we read the cython package
# requirement using `grep cython test_requirements.txt` instead of simply
# writing 'pip install setuptools wheel cython'.
pip install `grep cython test_requirements.txt`
