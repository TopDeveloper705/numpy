It provides:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Testing:

- NumPy versions &ge; 1.15 require `pytest`
- NumPy versions &lt; 1.15 require `nose`

Tests can then be run after installation with:

    python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'
